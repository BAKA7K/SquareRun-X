# Square Run X
A 2D platformer I created for my Computer Science coursework. <br />
This was made mainly using: <br />
* **OpenGL** for graphics handling.
* **GLFW** for window and input handling.
* **GLM** for mathematical features and operations.

**NOTE: Window size, game resolution etc can be modified in the config files found at 'GameFiles/Configs'.**
